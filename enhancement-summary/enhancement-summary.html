<h1>Enhancement Narrative</h1>
<p>
    For my ePortfolio, I chose to include the AnimalShelterCRUD project because it represents a clear point in my growth where backend structure, data awareness, and clean interface design all came together. I originally created this project during the CS 340 course, but the work I’ve done in CS 499 takes it to another level. The enhancements reflect more than just functional improvements—they show how I’ve started thinking like a professional software engineer working in production environments.
</p>
<p>
    The artifact itself is a backend module written in Python that connects to a MongoDB database to manage animal shelter records. It includes full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and was built to support a data visualization dashboard. I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it allowed me to revisit a working project with fresh eyes and tighten it up in ways that mirror industry expectations. Key updates included replacing hardcoded credentials with environment variables, adding input validation and logging, and improving read operations with filtering and pagination—all things that I’ve learned from recent real-world experience.
</p>
<p>
    This enhancement directly supports the course outcomes I outlined in Module One. My original goals were to focus on writing scalable, secure backend services and to better understand the flow of data through a layered application. Those outcomes were met and extended. While working through the enhancement, I also developed better habits around version control, documentation, and testing—things I initially underestimated but now realize are critical to professional development.
</p>
<p>
    Reflecting on the process, I think the most valuable thing I gained was the ability to step back and evaluate my own code like an outsider. Doing the code review in Milestone One forced me to call out issues like loose exception handling, unnecessary tight coupling, and poor abstraction. Then, making those changes in Milestone Two pushed me to look at how my code would scale—not just whether it works. I ran into some challenges updating the read logic to return bulk data more efficiently without over-fetching, but it helped me better understand how Mongo handles query performance.
</p>
<p>
    This project isn't about showcasing flashy features—it’s about showing how I write practical, responsible backend code that could stand up in a real-world repo. It shows how I document my process, how I protect user data, and how I evolve a basic feature set into something more robust. That’s the story I want this artifact to tell in my ePortfolio.
